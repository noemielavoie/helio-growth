Here follows script and figures for the analysis of growth curve data from 2021_03_31 where I grew pshB2 H. modesticaldum mutant phototrophically in  medium PYE + 20uM FeSO4 under different NaHCO3- treatments. No HCO3-, 1mM and 20mM. Biological triplicates were used for each treatment.

```{r}
##code to open and access datafile
## make excel datasheet into R Dataframe, do you have all packages required?
library(tidyverse)
##readxl is part of tidyverse, but when you load tidyverse after installation it doesnt add readxl by default
library(readxl)
##your data was preloaded in the Rproject directory, so then use read_excel fucntion to retrieve the data
HCO3_pshB2 <- read_excel("2021_03_31_pshB2_HCO3.xlsx")
##Make your first graph for fun
ggplot(data = HCO3_pshB2, aes(x = hours, y = OD, colour = treatment, shape = as.factor(biol_rep_number))) +
  geom_point()
```

Next up is testing for statistically significant differences between treatments.For this we will compare treatments vs mean OD (at each timepoint as mean of all 3 biological reps). Will have to do a refresh on hypothesis testing approaches.
